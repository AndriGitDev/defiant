# NVD API Key - REQUIRED for CVE Data
# =====================================
# This application fetches real-time CVE data from the NIST National Vulnerability Database.
# An API key is strongly recommended to avoid rate limiting issues.
#
# Without key: 5 requests per 30 seconds (may cause timeouts)
# With key: 50 requests per 30 seconds (reliable real-time data)
#
# Get your FREE API key at: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
# (Approval is usually instant)
#
# For local development, create .env.local file:
# NVD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
#
# For Vercel/Production deployment:
# Add NVD_API_KEY as an environment variable in your hosting dashboard
# Remember to redeploy after adding the key

# Database URL - OPTIONAL for Caching
# =====================================
# This application can use a PostgreSQL database (Neon serverless recommended) to cache
# CVE data for faster searches and reduced API calls.
#
# Benefits of database caching:
# - Faster keyword search across all cached CVEs
# - Reduced API calls to NVD and EUVD (rate limit friendly)
# - Better search results from accumulated data
# - Persistent storage of vulnerability data
#
# To set up with Neon:
# 1. Create a free account at https://neon.tech
# 2. Create a new project
# 3. Copy the connection string from the dashboard
# 4. Run database migrations: npm run db:push
#
# Connection string format:
# postgresql://user:password@host/database?sslmode=require
